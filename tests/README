Tests consist of the following:
control.csv - A file containing a control set for each timestep.
	A control file is a csv where each line has two values: a degree change (in radians) and a distance traveled (or velocity during that time step, which is equal to distance moved in that time step)
	Example:
		0,1
		pi,1
measure.csv - A file containing a measurement set for each timestep.
	A measurement file is a csv where each line has M measusurements and each measurement value is a pair of colon separated values representing the direction and distance for each reading. (M should be consistent per line)
	Ex:
	0:1,pi:0.5,pi/3:10
	0:1,pi:1,pi/3:6
ground.csv - A file containing the ground truth position of the agent at each timestep (shown in red)
	T+1 entries
	Each entry is of the form
	x,y,phi
map.pgm - A .pgm format file containing the map for the test.
	To create:
	Draw a picture (or pull on off the internet)
	Use the terminal command convert to:
	convert <image> <newname>.pgm
	To create a properly formatted file.
	Use it.
	NOTE: The image is inverted in our format, so black areas are made empty space and appear white.


NOTE: Test cases may fail to converge to a solution, don't worry if this happens occasionally  (or more on large maps)
Test 1:
A hallway with one room on either side. Start state = (19,10,pi/2)
Test 2:
A circlular room with no distinguishing features. Start state = (50,50,0)
Test 3:
Mutliple separate rooms. Start state = (3,5,3pi/2).
Test 4:
A hallway with rooms on one side. Start state = (60, 10, pi/2)
Test 5:
A hallway with rooms on one side. Start state = (70, 180, 3pi/2)
Test CIT1:
The CIT, Start state = (600, 400, 3.7)
Test CIT2:
The CIT, Start state = (600, 400, 3.7). (Movements are larger, so things are more noisy, but visualization is nice)
